                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p> For my first two work terms, I participated in an 8-month internship at PureFacts Financial Solutions. 
                    While the company's office is based in Toronto, my work was done remotely from my home in Guelph.
                    My first experience coding in a professional setting helped me hone my communication skills, as well as 
                    becoming comfortable with the use of various languages and technical skills.

                <h2>MY EMPLOYER</h2>
                <p>

                <h2>LEARNING GOALS</h2>
                <p>
                    When first work term began, I was uncertain about how to make goals that were both challenging and achievable.
                    Now, with it coming to a close, I can say in confidence that I have learned just as much about making goals for myself
                    as I've learned from the goals themselves.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <b>My Goals:</b>
                    <li>Become comfortable navigating a full-stack application and understanding the connection between front-end and back-end elements (MVC)</li>
                    <li>Aim to complete one ticket/task/subtask (for larger features) per day.</li>
                    <li>Understand the development cycle in a professional setting (updating old products, developing new ones)</li>
                    <li>Learn how to tackle a large project by collaborating with team members</li>
                    <li>Actively engage in stand-up meetings on a daily basis</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    I believe that my goals were both helpful and relevant to my work tasks, if not a bit naive. I wasn't yet sure what I wanted
                    professionally; As I worked with every member of the core development team across both legacy and upcoming software, I was
                    given the freedom to explore various aspects of the company's tech stack and learn not only about the software itself,
                    but about my own interests and what I wanted to work with. For example, I quite easily picked up front-end development tasks
                    and was able to move on to larger, more challenging projects like creating widgets for an online dashboard.

                    Overall, I feel that I successfully accomplished all my goals except 2. This was the most rigidly-defined goal, as the others
                    were more focused on familiarizing myself with coding in a professional setting. I believe that the main reason I was 
                    unsuccessful was due to a lack of personal understanding and flexibility. At the beginning of my term I worke primarily on 
                    small bugs and UI cleanup, so one task a day seemed more than reasonable - but some tasks will inevitably take longer than others,
                    and unprecedented complications and blocks can arise when working with other developers. So, while I didn't quite meet the 
                    requirement that I set for myself, I still learned a lot from the goal and will carry this understanding with me through my future
                    experiences.

                <h2>JOB DESCRIPTION</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Software Development Intern at PureFacts, I worked full-stack to design, develop and maintain two pieces of software for the 
                    company: their legacy PureFacts application, and a new in-progress application for their next generation of software.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The skills required for the job involved a range of languages and frameworks including React and ExtJS, Typescript, C#, and SQL,
                    as well as source control using git and Azure DevOps.
                    From my classes I had had experience with some basic Javascript, SQL and GitLab, but almost everything about the company's 
                    codebase was new to me when I first set up the application on my local computer. Through careful observation and thoughtful questions, as 
                    well as hands-on experience completing tickets, I was able to navigate and quickly learn the skills necessary to succeed - even 
                    exceeding my employer's expectations for growth and taking on larger projects.

                    Below is a graph that I developed for the company's report generation system:

                <p>
                    During my work term I also learned how to effectively communicate my progress - as well as questions and concerns - 
                    with other team members, primarily during our daily morning standups. By the end of my term I felt that I could easily
                    work with members of my team, while also improving my own independence and confidence in picking up larger tasks.

                <h2>CONCLUSIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>
                <p>
                    While I started my work term inexperienced and unsure about what to expect, I feel that just a few months working with 
                    PureFacts have brought me a long way. I have quickly become comfortable with developing new software using various programming
                    languages as well as maintaining and fixing older software. Additionally, I have gained critical experience in communicating
                    and working as part of a team. My success in achieving my own personal goals leaves me confident in the work term to come,
                    and my future in Computer Science as a whole.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I would like to thank Seung-Mi Shin - my mentor - for supporting me and being a friendly face throughout this journey,
                    Zeyad Abdulghani for providing support and supervision as I navigated new territory and learned the ropes, 
                    and the PureFacts team as a whole for being an excellent and knowledgeable group to work with every step of the way.
