                <div class="leftBody">
                    <h2 id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                    <p> For my first two work terms, I participated in an 8-month internship at PureFacts Financial Solutions. 
                        While the company's office is based in Toronto, my work was done remotely from my home in Guelph.
                        My first experience coding in a professional setting helped me hone my communication skills, as well as 
                        becoming comfortable with the use of various languages and technical skills.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="rightBody">

                    <p>
                        Combining corporate and personal values - that's what makes PureFacts Financial Solutions stand out

                        food, shelter, and education to those in need, including scholarship and mentorship opportunites for students

                    <h2 id="goals">LEARNING GOALS</h2>
                    <p>
                        When first work term began, I was uncertain about how to make goals that were both challenging and achievable.
                        Now, with it coming to a close, I can say in confidence that I have learned just as much about making goals for myself
                        as I've learned from the goals themselves.
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <b>My Goals:</b>
                        <li>Become comfortable navigating a full-stack application and understanding the connection between front-end and back-end elements (MVC)</li>
                        <li>Aim to complete one ticket/task/subtask (for larger features) per day</li>
                        <li>Understand the development cycle in a professional setting (updating old products, developing new ones)</li>
                        <li>Learn how to tackle a large project by collaborating with team members</li>
                        <li>Actively engage in stand-up meetings on a daily basis</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        I believe that my goals were both helpful and relevant to my work tasks, if not a bit naive. I wasn't yet sure what I wanted
                        professionally; As I worked with every member of the core development team across both legacy and upcoming software, I was
                        given the freedom to explore various aspects of the company's tech stack and learn not only about the software itself,
                        but about my own interests and what I wanted to work with. For example, I quite easily picked up front-end development tasks
                        and was able to move on to larger, more challenging projects like creating widgets for an online dashboard.

                        Overall, I feel that I successfully accomplished all my goals except 2. This was the most rigidly-defined goal, as the others
                        were more focused on familiarizing myself with coding in a professional setting. I believe that the main reason I was 
                        unsuccessful was due to a lack of personal understanding and flexibility. At the beginning of my term I worke primarily on 
                        small bugs and UI cleanup, so one task a day seemed more than reasonable - but some tasks will inevitably take longer than others,
                        and unprecedented complications and blocks can arise when working with other developers. So, while I didn't quite meet the 
                        requirement that I set for myself, I still learned a lot from the goal and will carry this understanding with me through my future
                        experiences.
                    </p>

                <div class="rightBody">
                    <h2 id="job">JOB DESCRIPTION</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a Software Development Intern at PureFacts, I worked full-stack to design, develop and maintain two pieces of software for the 
                        company: their legacy PureFacts application, and a new in-progress application for their next generation of software.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The skills required for the job involved a range of languages and frameworks including React and ExtJS, Typescript, C#, and SQL,
                        as well as source control using git and Azure DevOps.
                        From my classes I had had experience with some basic Javascript, SQL and GitLab, but almost everything about the company's 
                        codebase was new to me when I first set up the application on my local computer. Through careful observation and thoughtful questions, as 
                        well as hands-on experience completing tickets, I was able to navigate and quickly learn the skills necessary to succeed - even 
                        exceeding my employer's expectations for growth and taking on larger projects.

                        Below is a graph that I developed for the company's report generation system:

                    <p>
                        During my work term I also learned how to effectively communicate my progress - as well as questions and concerns - 
                        with other team members, primarily during our daily morning standups. By the end of my term I felt that I could easily
                        work with members of my team, while also improving my own independence and confidence in picking up larger tasks.

                    <h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>
                    <p>
                        While I started my work term inexperienced and unsure about what to expect, I feel that just a few months working with 
                        PureFacts have brought me a long way. I have quickly become comfortable with developing new software using various programming
                        languages as well as maintaining and fixing older software. Additionally, I have gained critical experience in communicating
                        and working as part of a team. My success in achieving my own personal goals leaves me confident in the work term to come,
                        and my future in Computer Science as a whole.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I would like to thank Seung-Mi Shin - my mentor - for supporting me and being a friendly face throughout this journey,
                        Zeyad Abdulghani for providing support and supervision as I navigated new territory and learned the ropes, 
                        and the PureFacts team as a whole for being an excellent and knowledgeable group to work with every step of the way.
