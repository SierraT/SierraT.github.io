            <h1>Work Term 2 - FALL 2023</h1>

            <div class="leftBody">
                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p> For my first two work terms, I participated in an 8-month internship at PureFacts Financial Solutions. 
                    While the company's office is based in Toronto, my work was done remotely from my home in Guelph.
                    During this second half of my work term, I expanded upon the knowledge I gained and was able to experiment 
                    further with new languages and skills.
                </p>

                <h2>MY EMPLOYER</h2>

            <div class="leftBody">
                <h2>LEARNING GOALS</h2>
                <p>
                    With my first four months under my belt, I felt capable and ready to jump into the second half of my assignment. This new term came 
                    new goals tailored to gaining new skills, practicing and honing those that I had already gained, and developing good habits for future projects.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <b>My Goals:</b>
                    <li>Expand knowledge in langauges and tools within my company's tech stack that I am still not confident in - with a focus on backend-database connections such as Hangfire and SQL</li>
                    <li>Take initiative in asking for more complicated tickets/projects, while testing and understanding my limits</li>
                    <li>Interact with coworkers outside of my core team to better understand how my work affects the company as a whole</li>
                    <li>Put extra care and focus into testing, trying to avoid making errors that need to be fixed with subsequent pull requests</li>
                    <li>Continue to keep detailed notes on daily tasks / questions / thoughts, and effectively recap these notes at my weekly meetings with my mentor</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    This term I achieved success in all my goals. After a talk with my supervisors I was given tasks that focused more on backend and database work, an area in which I felt 
                    I had less experience. As a result, I encountered more roadblocks. Those roadblocks were handled effectively by discussing problems and questions with team members. I quickly 
                    learned how to gauge if a task was too confusing or difficult and reach out to team members for assistance. On top of this, I joined in on meetings beyond the scope of my team -- 
                    one with the entire company involved -- to gain better insight into the overall function of PureFacts and the interactions between departments. After completing so many tasks in the first 
                    term of my assignment, I was beginning to get a feel for the full process of software development; not just coding, but planning, analyzing, and executing those changes in a way that is 
                    non-disruptive to my coworkers. I successfully employed my strategy to double-check changed files before merging code in order to avoid mistakes that would have to be fixed later on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While I consider myself successful in my goals for this term, I still recognize room for my improvement in the future. Upon reflection of this work term -- and of this co-op assignment as a whole -- I feel 
                    that I could have made much faster progress if I had asked for more challenging tickets or showed more interest in learning the more complicated aspects of our company's projects sooner. In meetings, I could have 
                    spoken up and made more of an effort to understand my colleague's tasks as well as my own. I have certainly shown an improvement in my programming skill and independence, but in order to improve beyond this point 
                    I must put more effort into learning from others and seeking out new challenges that will encourage me to grow. I am excited to make a more outward attempt at being involved with my company in future work terms and in 
                    my eventual career in Computer Science.

                <h2>JOB DESCRIPTION</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Software Development Intern at PureFacts, I worked full-stack to design, develop and maintain two pieces of software for the 
                    company: their legacy PureFacts application, and a new in-progress application for their next generation of software.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The skills required for the job involved a range of languages and frameworks including React and ExtJS, Typescript, C#, and SQL,
                    as well as source control using git and Azure DevOps.
                    While most of my tasks from the first term were centered around ExtJS, React and Typescript, this term I expanded further into C# and SQL. I can proudly
                    say that I have grown comfortable in all these languages. I was able to independently write SQL for database scripts, and edit the backend of API calls to return 
                    properly formatted data. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was able to effectively manage my time, deciding when it was necessary to contact other team members for help and recognizing when I could easily look into a problem on 
                    my own. Both approaches improved my understanding of the company's code, as well as approaches to coding in general. I am proud to be more fluent than ever, not only in programming languages 
                    themselves, but in the IDEs and tools necessary for modern developers to streamline their work.
                </p>

                <h2>CONCLUSIONS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h2>
                <p>
                    Working at PureFacts has left me feeling fulfilled and ready to enter into the professional world of Computer Science. I entered the second term of this 8-month 
                    co-op with confidence and curiosity, and left it with a new sense of understanding of all parts of the development process. I am certain that the knowledge gained from 
                    this experience will be invaluable in my future prospects -- both personal and professional. However, I feel that my newly-gained skills are now in need of expanding and honing. 
                    In the future I hope to take on more challenging projects (not just bug fixes!) and to continue to improve my communication with my coworkers, bringing a sense of curiosity and initiative into 
                    everything I do.
                </p>
                    Special thanks are given to Chris Wang and Samuel Kim for their willingness to support and tailor my tasks to what I was most excited to learn, 
                    and the great attitude and direction given to the PureFacts team over the wonderful last 8 months.
