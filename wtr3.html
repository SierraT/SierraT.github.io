                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        This work term featured a fast-paced environment with many different tasks across an array of projects. Technical skills
                        required involved PHP, Git, WordPress and AWS. While I had little experience with most of these (barring git) in school,
                        the coding and learning abilities I have developed in class gave me a solid jumping off point to start with. I was able to
                        effectively use independent search and LinkedIn learning to develop further knowledge, as well as gaining hands-on experience
                        within the job itself.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        Non-technical skills included effective communication, creativity, time management and independent work. These are all skills
                        that I have developed both in-class and in prior work terms, and gained more experience with this term. The many projects that 
                        I worked on within four months demanded the ability to quickly learn new skills and frameworks, including ones that hadn't been 
                        used by the company before. This put me in a unique position where I gained experience writing documentation and instructions to 
                        help guide future work on team projects.

                    <p class="pl-4 sm:pr-40"> 
                        My first project served as an introduction to the company's many web publishing pursuits. I was required to design and implement 
                        WordPress components for a new product site. As the culmination to this work, I used AWS LightSail to start up an entirely new server
                        for future web applciations.

                        Sapphire is the company's internal management software, used to create custom ads for platforms such as Google and Facebook. I was
                        able to hone my PHP skills to connect between frontend and backend, adding new functionality that saw immediate use from my fellow 
                        employees. For example, I added the ability to add and crop multiple images, as well as uploading previous images to new ad campaigns.

                        In preparation for a new project involving data aggregation, I was required to use multiple tools to automate the scraping of data 
                        across multiple websites. I not only did this work myself, but I also used technical writing skills to develop instructions and example 
                        data sets for other workers to increase efficiency of results.

                        I was able to practice custom component design for a brand new website, as well as implementing flats into a working application. I learned
                        to use the Laravel framework to combine HTML with PHP, Tailwind CSS, raw Javascript and Alpine.JS to quickly implement a clean, responsive
                        website during the last month of my work term. Additionally, I provided documentation through Confluence to assist in future use of the framework.

                            and documentation, while also rounding out transferable skills like communication and independence. My initial goals were developed
                            relating to my first few weeks of job experience. Because the needs of this workplace were constantly evolving, however, some of my
                            initial goals were less relevant than initially expected. Regardless, I met each goal to the best of my abilities and was able to expand 
                            upon my knowledge in other areas, finding additional topics of interest throughout the term.

                            My primary interest this summer was to learn more about the different aspects of (and technologies used in) web development. Many of the skills I

                            Given the job description and my first few weeks working with AWS as a host for web applications, I knew that learning cloud-based
                            web services would be relevant to not only my job, but my future in web development as a whole. The shift in web development to cloud 
                            storage platforms demands an understanding of web services like AWS to quickly host web servers.

                        <p class="pl-4">
                            This work term, I sought to conduct personal research through Youtube tutorials and LinkedIn learning to understand the basics of how
                            cloud computing works, with a focus on AWS LightSail. I hoped to take extensive notes to familiarize myself for future projects and grow
                            comfortable using AWS services without guidance.

                            <strong>Reflection:</strong> I researched the basic fundamentals of AWS and cloud-based web services using online tools such as Youtube
                            and LinkedIn learning, taking notes on the subject. I quickly became comfortable with using Amazon Lightsail and was even able to create
                            a new server using AWS tools and guidance from my manager. Unfortunately my work with AWS was limited to this, so I feel that there is still
                            much to learn about the subject. This work term served as a good introduction to the topic and has me interested in taking courses or practing 
                            further to help me understand this technology. Knowing how important cloud-based web architecture is in the modern web, I look forward to

                            The frequent context-switching and eccentric nature of this experience lent itself well to creative and independent solutions.
                            This term, I tried to focus on bringing my own solutions to the table and trusting my experience in both design and programming to 
                            lead me to a solution independently. On the other hand, it is important to collobarate with team members and ensure solutions are viable

                            - Speak up, ask questions, and provide personal knowledge to discussions
                            - Check in with supervisors or related parties frequently and when confused

                            to succeed in this goal. My last project especially gave me the chance to do independent research and pass along my unique knowledge through
                            the creation of Confluence documents, while still allowing me to fall back on my peers for assistance with sticking points and confusing errors. 
                            The action plan I laid out in my Learning Goals guided me to become comfortable speaking up about ideas and issues in a workplace setting and bringing
                            creative solutions to the table. Developing these skills has increased my confidence in being able to bring valuable information to future

                            While WordPress itself only featured a small portion of my tasks this term, the web design skills I gained reach far beyond a specific content management system and have
                            bolstered my confidence in being able to implement web solutions in general across an array of technologies and platforms.

                            While I have kept up well with taking notes in class and prior work terms, I found I often overestimated the amount
                            of information I needed to note down. The result was a notebook cramped with notes I didn't need, and it was often
                            time-consuming to sift through to remember what I actually needed to know. 
                            This work term, I planned to be more concise and clear with my notes to better track my progress. I expected that 
                            creating documentation for my code would assist in this.

                            "padding out" my notes with unnecessary detail. As a result, I was able to easily compile the information I learned
                            this term into a confluence document to pass my knowledge on to other employees. This document will assist others in 
                            onboarding for the project and for efficient development once set up.

                            An area that I can still improve in is commenting and document the actual code files I work on as I go. It can be difficult 
                            to remember to do in the moment, but can lead to confusion for both myself and others later on. I hope to address this in future projects 
                            and work terms, as this will increase readability and help me communicate with my peers.

                            PHP is the main language used in most of Adknown's projects. I had never used PHP before, but I knew that it was an important language in 
                            web-development with stacks like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), so I resolved to make the most of this term and become as comfortable 
                            with PHP as possible. To do this, I planned to:
                                - Take notes on parts of PHP that are unique
                                - Research or ask questions on any confusing elements
                                - Make efforts to code efficiently and effectively

                            <strong>Reflection:</strong> I was fully immersed in PHP-based tools this semester. Introducing myself to the language through online learning sites 
                            was a helpful introduction, but most of my skills came from actively coding in the language for four months.

                            As a result, I was able to quickly pick 
                            up the language and use it to my advantage. Clear note-taking was key to understanding larger projects like Sapphire. I feel that my ability to quickly 
                            and effectively pick up new PHP projects demonstrates my newfound confidence with the language.

                            In addition to PHP, I had the ability to learn and document my experiences with Laravel, a PHP framework. I greatly enjoyed learning about features like 
                            Laravel's blade templates and coming up with creative solutions by exploring the framework's capabilities. I look forward to using this framework in future 
                            projects, and would love to use it more for work in the future.

                        I developed this term's learning goals with the first few weeks of my work term in mind. As such, the skills I hoped to develop
                        aligned closely with the onboarding tasks I was given. However, this term taught me much more than the few goals that I made. The past 
                        four months have improved my communication skills, given me more independence and confidence, and made me more adaptable to fluid situations
                        where one specific solution may not always apply. These skills are not easily learned in a class setting, so this work term proved to be 
                        an invaluable experience.

                        My tasks introduced me to lightweight, "easy" frameworks like TailwindCSS and Alpine.js, designed to be as simple to introduce into web applications
                        as possible. While I enjoy working in web development as a whole, these frameworks interested me with their simplicity and small amount of overhead.
                        In my search to learn more about this facet of web design, I came across interesting articles that made me more aware of the current web development climate
                        beyond education and internships, including the <a class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="https://infrequently.org/2018/09/the-developer-experience-bait-and-switch/">
                        bloat in many modern web applications.</a> I am interested in further researching this topic and its implications in modern web design.

                        My enjoyment with these new frameworks inspired me to redesign this blog using only raw HTML, Tailwind, and AlpineJS. I can safely say that I feel comfortable
                        adapting projects to different languages, designing visually appealing and informative web pages, and implementing my ideas in an efficient manner. After transforming
                        my work term blog into something I can really be proud of, I have no doub that these skills will benefit me in future projects and career opportunities.

                        My experience this summer has gone far beyond the workplace and my initial goals. After this term, I have become far more 
                        confident in my ability to provide creative and effective solutions in an efficient manner, to learn with or without guidance,
                        and to feel more comfortable advocating for myself and my solutions. Both the technical and transferable skills I have gained
                        or improved this semester have opened my eyes to the depth and complexity of a vast field, which I hope to explore more in future
                        classes and job opportunites.
