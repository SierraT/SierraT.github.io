                        This past winter I completed my fourth co-op work term as a software developer intern with Rocket Innovation Studio.
                        The following report summarizes the work I did for this term including job responsibilities, skills learned,
                        and how those skills will benefit my future educational, occupational and personal pursuits.

                    <p class="sm:pr-32"> 
                        <a class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="/">Rocket Innovation Studio.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        The goal of Rocket Innovation Studio is to find the best Canadian talent and set them up to thrive with a team that, in the words of their founder, is "obsessed with finding a better way". 
                        As part of the Rock family of companies, Rocket Innovation Studio makes use of cutting-edge technology to provide the best mortgage software in the business. Potential homeowners feel supported 
                        through every step of their journey, from house-hunting to refinancing years down the line.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        Internally, the company's culture supports every team member's personal journey to succeed. Frequent events, talks with executives, and foundational sayings (ISMs) keep everyone focused on the company's core mission to "help everyone home".
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        When I first stumbled upon their job posting, I asked myself: "what exactly is an ISM?" Throughout my term I came to understand. These little sayings, ranging from the seemingly-obvious "do the right thing" to the more dubious 
                        "we eat our own dog food" were all intended to lay out the core values of the company, instilling in every employee a set of guidelines to follow to uphold the archetype of the compassionate trailblazer: one who acts professionally 
                        and with purpose, never backs down from a challenge, and focuses on lifting up others as much as themselves.
                    </p>

                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        Having been placed on a team whose primary purpose was to support the company's larger projects, and especially in the wake of a major branding overhaul, required me to wear many hats when it came to the work I was doing. This ever-changing 
                        environment demanded diligence, collaboration, and a willingness to learn both independently as well as from mentors and teammates. These non-technical skills have been some of the most useful determiners of success both inside this role and 
                        otherwise for me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        Some of my tasks were the standard software development stories I was used to: features and bugs, working with familiar technologies such as React. However, ast the needs of my team and the rest of the company shifted, I found myself dabbling in various ends 
                        of the software development process. I dipped my toes into testing. automation, and even setting up infrastructure as code (IAC) and events with AWS.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        This work term challenged me to be flexible and adaptable, and to be willing to ask questions or seek help shamelessly when I needed it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        In addition to my daily tasks, my role featured plenty of opportunities for professional development. I attended company events, visiting the cities of Detroit and Windsor and learning of their historic significance to the company; I participated in 
                        Hackweek, where I practiced adding Lighthouse to test for performance and accessibility; and, finally, I finished off my term with a presentation about what I had done and learned in the past four months.

                    <p class="sm:pr-40">  
                        Working with Rocket was a brand new and breathtaking experience. With friendly and knowledgable peers to support me around every corner, I felt prepared to succeed at any task. My work this term not only taught me 
                        crucial new texhnologies, it also challenged me to improve my interpersonal skills, take ownership of my work, stay curious, and move forward with compassion and confidence. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        If I could caange one thing about this term, it would be to step outside the guidance of my own team. Broadening my horizons by connecting with others unrelated to the work I was doing could lead to even more diverse opportunities to learn 
                        and grow down the line, and the potential to eventually dabble in other interesting areas within the company that I hadn't even imagined.

                        Thanks to Rocket, I feel prepared and confident moving forward into my final year of studies. I am proud of how my abilities have grown and know that I can bring good work to the table. I am hungry to see what comes in the 
                        future, and to spread my reach even farther into the vast world of computer science.
