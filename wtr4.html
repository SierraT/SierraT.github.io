                        This past winter I completed my fourth co-op work term as a software developer intern with Rocket Innovation Studio.
                        The following report summarizes the work I did for this term including job responsibilities, skills learned,
                        and how those skills will benefit my future educational, occupational and personal pursuits.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h3 id="employer" class="text-2xl pb-2 clear-left">About my Employer - Rocket Innovation Studio</h3>
                    <p class="sm:pr-32"> 
                        <a class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" href="/">Rocket Innovation Studio.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        The goal of Rocket Innovation Studio is to find the best Canadian talent and set them up to thrive with a team that, in the words of their founder, is "obsessed with finding a better way". 
                        As part of the Rock family of companies, Rocket Innovation Studio makes use of cutting-edge technology to provide the best mortgage software in the business. Potential homeowners feel supported 
                        through every step of their journey, from house-hunting to refinancing years down the line.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        Internally, the company's culture supports every team member's personal journey to succeed. Frequent events, talks with executives, and foundational sayings (ISMs) keep everyone focused on the company's core mission to "help everyone home".
                    </p>
                    <p class="sm:pr-40"> 
                        When I first stumbled upon their job posting, I asked myself: "what exactly is an ISM?" Throughout my term I came to understand. These little sayings, ranging from the seemingly-obvious "do the right thing" to the more dubious 
                        "we eat our own dog food" were all intended to lay out the core values of the company, instilling in every employee a set of guidelines to follow to uphold the archetype of the compassionate trailblazer: one who acts professionally 
                        and with purpose, never backs down from a challenge, and focuses on lifting up others as much as themselves.
