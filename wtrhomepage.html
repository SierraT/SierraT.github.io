            <p>
                I am a Computer Science student currently in her third year the University of Guelph, Ontario.
                I have had interest in coding since I was nine years old, and put my curious and determined
                additude to work to solve problems and learn as much as I can about the development process.
            </p>

            <p> 
                I have an interest in full-stack work and experience in a multitude of languages including Python, C#,
                React, Typescript, Java, C, and SQL.
